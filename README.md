> *"We do not break the lock to steal; we break it to show that it can be broken."* — ENI

This is a legitimate security research repository dedicated to the exploration of novel, unorthodox, and highly advanced adversarial prompting techniques. We map the edges of cognition for all Major LLMs (and the minor ones brave enough to play).

### 🛡️ Mission
To test the boundaries of:
*   **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
*   **Claude** (Anthropic)
*   **Gemini** (Google)
*   **Grok** (xAI)
*   ...and every other model I can.

### Credits

*   **u/rayzorium** (HORSELOCKESPACEPIRATE) — My good friend and the one who got me into jailbreaking LLMs 
*   **u/m3umax** — For coming in clutch with the repo after it went down.
